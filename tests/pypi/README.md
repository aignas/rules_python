# PyPI integration

The `requirements.in` is just a big requirements file that is compiled using:
```console
uv pip compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt --no-build --generate-hashes --no-strip-extras --prerelease=allow
```

The `requirements.in` is generated by taking top 1000 and modifying it to compile https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/
